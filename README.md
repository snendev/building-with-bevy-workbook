# Building With Bevy Workbook: Crabber

##### snen.dev

This is the first commit of the Building With Bevy Workbook, which follows along
the [Building With Bevy blog series](https://blog.snen.dev/building-with-bevy).
Each commit in this repository represents a snapshot of the code at the end of
each post (and potentially other useful checkpoints as well).

This commit introduces as a
[Cargo workspace](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.html)
to configure the repository so that we can add crates as-needed.
