# Building With Bevy Workbook: Crabber

##### snen.dev

This is the first commit of the Building With Bevy Workbook, which follows along
the [Building With Bevy blog series](https://blog.snen.dev/building-with-bevy).
Each commit in this repository represents a snapshot of the code at the end of
each post (and potentially other useful checkpoints as well).

This commit introduces two crates:

- `crabber`, which will hold the code for the game and showcases a minimal set
  of Bevy features
- `common-e2e`, which streamlines creating testing and development scenes
